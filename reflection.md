The goal of this programming assignment was to practice creating modular code using functions, handle user input with error checking, and explore ASCII art design in Python.
The steps included analyzing requirements, breaking down tasks into functions, implementing ASCII designs, and creating a user-friendly menu with input handling.
Luckily, I was able to code all the designs correctly and have them run properly.
In addition, I ran many trials with my code to ensure that the code ran properly and smoothly. 
One of the challenges I faced was having the art using the characters line up correctly and that the image was visibly correct.
I overcame this challenge by testing each function individually and refining designs based on alignment and usability.
Something I took away from this programming assignment was that its cool to use and that designs require careful planning.
Working alone encouraged me to be thorough in planning and testing, as there was no immediate feedback from others.
While it can be challenging without collaboration, it provides a valuable opportunity for in-depth practice and understanding.
